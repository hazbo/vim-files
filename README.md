### My Vim Config

This is more or less [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) but
my own version of it with a few more tweeks and extra support for
[golang](http://golang.org).

You can clone this down and use the install script which just
moves the configuration files for you, or you could just
install using [Asink](http://github.com/groundsix/asink).

```bash
asink get https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hazbo/vim-files/master/Asinkfile
```

This will grab all the files, install and then clean up after itself.
